This project is aimed at simulating the performance of a manufacturing system in a single day (8 hours). This system consists of 3 machines; A, B, and C. Each of these machines have their own unique work time, down time, and parts-arrival rate.
The simulation model is run 10 times to estimate the performance parmeters of the system via point estimation and interval estimation. Each run consists of two phases: a warmup phase, and a main phase which the system is evaluated upon.
The warmup phase is a 2 hour simulation and is used to reduce the bias of our estimations.
After the simulation we also return charts about the performance of each machine to check for bottlenecks.
